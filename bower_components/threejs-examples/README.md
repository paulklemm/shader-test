threejs-examples
=================

A small package containing the javascript files in the [examples][]
folder from the [Three.js][] library.

These files contain useful additions and utilities for three.js and are
not included in some versions of the threejs bower package.

This package is designed to be used with [threejs-build][], which is a
versioned, minimal build of threejs, and downloads in a fraction of the
time of the versioned threejs bower packages.

Installation
-------------

```
bower install threejs-build threejs-examples
```

Need a new version?
--------------------

If you need a new version of this package, please [open an issue][].


Development
------------

If you'd like to change the way the package is distributed, please
have a look at [threejs-builder][]. Pull requests are welcome there!
